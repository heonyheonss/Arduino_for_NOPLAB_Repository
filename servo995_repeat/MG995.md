In this project, I used only one Arduino UNO board.

[About Servo Motor]
Power Tower MG995 is servo motor that has limited angle from 0 to 180 degree.
In my case, it needed its exclusive power supply(5 - 7.5 V), which not included in arduino.

[Wire connection]
Red, at the middle, supply wire, connect power supply +.
Brown, at the right, ground wire, connect power supply - and GND on the Arduino UNO board.
Yellow, at the left, signal wire, connect signal pin on the Arduino UNO board.
